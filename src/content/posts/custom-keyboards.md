&emsp;Here we go. I have a lot of keyboards, like an absurd amount of keyboards. It is one of those hobbies that, when you get into it, there is kind of just no going back. Currently, I have three keyboards that I keep in rotation on my desk. I have a few more that I mostly just keep for show at this point, but I do try to use them too from time to time. My family thinks I have a problem, but I think they are just jealous.
<br />
&emsp;I started off with a prebuilt mechanical keyboard and when I found out that there are a lot more options and that you can even custom build them yourself to look and feel exactly the way that you want, I was hooked. I have been building and collecting keyboards for a few years now and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon. I am someone that loves doing things with my hands and then seeing and using the results of that work and building keyboards really scratches that itch.
