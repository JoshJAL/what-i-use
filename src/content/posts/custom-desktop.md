&emsp;My main computer for developing websites and software, editing videos, and playing games. I built my first computer in 2017 and have been upgrading it ever since. I have a lot of fun building computers and learning about the latest hardware. I also enjoy the challenge of finding the best parts for the best price.
<br />
&emsp;In the past I have done some video editing for lawyers, a textile sales company, friends, and various personal projects. Video editing requires a pretty intense setup depending on what you are doing with it so I originally spec'd out my computer to handle whatever that was going to throw at it. While I still do some light video editing when the need arises, I have since moved on to other projects and, since becoming a developer professionally, my computer is used primarily for web and software development.
<br />
&emsp;I thoroughly enjoy writing code on my computer. I enjoy learning new things and finding new projects to sink my teeth into. Having a powerful computer makes it a lot easier to do that. While it is certainly not a requirement I have found it a lot less painful to have my ten thousand tabs, music, and code editor all open when there is not only the space to do so, but the tech to handle it.
<br />
&emsp;In my free time I enjoy playing some games with my friends. My current obsessions are Valorant and The Binding of Isaac: Repentance. While I don't find as much time as I used to for gaming, I still enjoy it when I can.

The fans were a gift and I don't remember the brand, but they are pretty quiet.
