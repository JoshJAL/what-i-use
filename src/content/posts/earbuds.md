&emsp;Not only do I like to listen to music or YouTube videos while I am working, but I like to do the same when I am on the go, or sometimes, when my head gets tired of having headphones on it, or if I just don't feel like messing up my hair I will definitely use earbuds. I have three pairs of earbuds that I regularly switch between and I definitely have a preference. Not that any are a bad choice, but one is just perfect for me.
<br />
&emsp;If you can't tell, I am a little picky when it comes to audio. I am not big on a lot of focus on the highs, I prefer a balanced EQ and base is not all that important to me; I just want a warm sound that doesn't feel offensive to my ears. When it comes to earbuds I find that noise isolation/cancellation is really important because they are mostly used outside of my home in a somewhat noisy environment. All of the earbuds that I use are great at that especially when you use memory foam ear tips. I also recommend memory foam ear tips just in genera because they are really comfortable and they help to seal the earbuds in your ear canal.
<br />
&emsp;We'll start with the most well known. I have a pair of Apple Airpod Pro's that I mostly use for working out (when I actually do workout), or when I REALLY don't want to have a wire for some reason. Having a wire usually does not bother me at all, but there are times when I just need to grab something and go. The airpods aren't bad by any means, but they certainly aren't great at really anything. Their audio quality is okay, they are really comfortable, and, for the most part, they have great noise cancellation. The only real problem I have with them is that they are really expensive for what they are. I would recommend them to anyone that is looking for a pair of wireless earbuds, but I would also recommend that they look at other options first, especially if you prioritize great sound over any of the other features that they offer.
<br />
&emsp;Next up the Tin HiFi T2's. I love these earbuds. They are relatively inexpensive, they produce a great sound, and they have great noise isolation. They are ridiculously comfortable and because they wrap around your ear they aren't going anywhere. These earbuds are great for everything and I truly do recommend these to anyone that isn't exclusively looking for something wireless. These mostly stay at the office for me.
<br />
&emsp;Finally, my favorites, the Tin HiFI T3's. For me, these are perfect, they provide a really warm, really full sound with great bass and great mids. They are unbelievably comfortable, they look great, they have great noise isolation, and they are also relatively inexpensive (and always on sale). I use these for everything, I use them at home, I use them at work, I use them when I am on the go. I love these earbuds and I can't recommend them enough.
