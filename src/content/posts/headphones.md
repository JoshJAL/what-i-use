&emsp;I like to listen to music or have some kind of YouTube video playing in the background while I am working on something. I have two different headphones that I use for this. I use the closed back headphones when I really want to hear the base of my music and I use the open back headphones when I want to have a more open sound stage. Mostly, I stick to the open back headphones regardless, but if I feel I truly need to focus, or I am on a plane, I use the closed back ones.
<br />
&emsp;If you don't know the difference between open back and closed back headphones it means exactly what it says; the back part of the headphone where the drivers sit is either opened or closed. There are benefits to both and no right answer as to which is best, but if you want to break it down to the most basic and blanketed way that you can, a closed back headphone will produce more base than an open back headphone and an open back headphone will provide a more open sound stage allowing you to pick out different instruments more effectively. Again, this isn't a hard and fast rule, but it is a good starting point if you don't want to weight yourself down with nuance.
<br />
&emsp;My open back headphone of choice is the Sennheiser HD 58X Jubilee. I love these headphones. I feel like I get a great, balanced sound out of them and I use them daily. They are a really popular headphone and as soon as you see them I am sure that you will recognize them from somewhere. I couldn't recommend them more.
<br />
&emsp;That being said, I would never recommend using an open back headphone in public, anyone in the room with you can hear exactly what you are listening to and, while that can be reason enough, I am sure that you don't want to bother everyone around you anyways. For that reason I also use the Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro 80 Ohm. These are a closed back headphone with great base that doesn't wash away the mids or the highs. I use these when I really need to buckle down and focus on something because the closed back nature of them makes me feel like I am in my own little bubble. Not only that, but they have surprisingly good noise isolation so I find that they are great on a plane or in public in general. I would recommend these to anyone that is looking for a closed back headphone.
