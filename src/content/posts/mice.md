&emsp;Okay, so I can explain. If you saw my keyboard collection and now you're looking at my mouse collection you definitely think I have a problem. I don't, I swear. For the most part this obsession with mice has stopped, but I spend a lot of time at my computer and I want not only to be comfortable, but to have the best tools I can.
<br />
&emsp;This one is a little easier to explain than the keyboards if I am being honest. I used to play a lot more games than I do now, especially first-person shooter games like Rainbow Six: Siege, Call of Duty, and Valorant. Having a mouse that feels comfortable for your grip style (don't ask unless you want to go down another rabbit hole) and is performant can make a huge difference in your game. I have tried a lot of different mice and I have found that I like the Razer Viper the best, to the point where I have had most of the iterations of this mouse. It is a little on the expensive side, but it is worth it. It is the only mouse that I am consistently coming back to and has a permanent place on my desk.
<br />
&emsp;For a while I wanted to find the most comfortable mouse for me and that is where most of the collection came from. I always have a few different mice on my desk even to this day. I am not really as concerned with my mouse now and am happy just using the Razer Viper, but I still have a few other mice that I like to use from time to time, so I keep them close for when I want to switch.
