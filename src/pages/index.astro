            As a web and software developer, I spend a lot of time in front of a
            computer. I use a lot of different tools and services to help me get
            my work done. Here are some of the tools I use on a daily basis.
            <br />
            <br />
            This is just a place to point people to so they can get to know me and
            my working environment a little better. I will provide links to whatever
            I can, but some of the tools I use I built myself (keyboards and computer),
            but I will list the parts I used to build them. Feel free to reach out
            if you have any questions or just want to chat about anything you find
            here! I'm always happy to talk about my setup. <a
